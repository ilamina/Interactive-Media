		<!--  Add bold text -About Me-->
			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>My name is Iyanu Lamina. I am originally from <i>Nigeria</i>, but I attend Concordia College, MN, where I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Computing and Data Analytics, and a minor in Web Design and Development. I use she/her pronouns. My favorite food is rice with any kind of meat.

			I come from a family of eight siblings, and I love my family very much. In <i>Nigeria</i>, there are many ethnic groups with different languages, but the three major ethnic groups are Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa. I am from the Yoruba tribe and was born and raised with a strong understanding of my culture.

			My interests include cooking and playing sports such as basketball, soccer, and track and field. Although I am not actively involved in sports on campus, I try to engage in these hobbies during my leisure time. Lastly, I love helping people, and I do that best through volunteering work.</p>
		
			<p>I am currently studying to become a data analyst as well as a web designer. However, my passion lies between being a web designer and a data analyst. I love both career paths.

			In my leisure time, I enjoy coding in <b>HTML and CSS</b> as well as building reports or dashboards in <b>Power BI or Tableau</b>. Outside of class, when I have the chance, I participate in some organizations and clubs on campus.

			So far, my favorite classes have been Web Design and Development, Software Engineering, and all my data classes: Data Mining, Introduction to Data Analytics, and Applied Statistical Models. These are my favorite classes because I get to work on projects, apply my skills, and grow in this field. Working on projects that interest me excites me and motivates me to work hard. Overall, I appreciate these classes because the topics taught and the skills gained can be applied to real-world problems in the professional or business world.</p>
